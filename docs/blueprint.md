## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich purple (#6C4AB6) for a sophisticated and modern feel, drawing from the concepts of multilingualism and intelligence in the app's functionality. Chosen for its versatility and balance between vibrancy and subtlety, contrasting well on light and dark backgrounds.
- Background color: Light gray (#F2F0F4), a desaturated tint of purple, complements the primary color, establishing the desired light color scheme. Creates a professional and calm environment for focusing on content.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#9D79BC) provides a gentle contrast to the primary color, and brings a sense of calm.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) provides a clean, modern look and is suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to present information clearly, balancing density with plenty of whitespace for ease of use.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and loading states, creating a polished user experience without unnecessary distraction.
- Utilize a consistent set of line icons from Lucide React, maintaining visual clarity and complementing the modern design aesthetic.
